What is BitcoinTop?
-----------------------

Bitcoin Top (BTT) is a fork of Bitcoin that occurs at the predetermined height of block 501118 
and therewith a new chain will be generated as the BTT. Bitcoin Top miners will begin creating 
blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and will consecutively develop and enhance the protection 
for account transfer and privacy based on original features of BTC. This will cause a bifurcation of 
the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch
of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. It shares the same transaction history 
with Bitcoin until it starts branching and coming into a unique block from which it diverges. 
As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency was created which we call “Bitcoin Top”.
